# Collaboration Picture

The following project is an edited version of a page from a project. The purpose of this page is the creation of an animation using words from a database from feedback users have given for an image; this version is an edited version that uses pre-determined words. The animation itself is a series of bubbles with varying sizes that bounce of the edge of the canvas and produces a chime noise. Upon clicking a bubble on the canvas, the user is able to edit the size of the bubble and the foreground colour of the image itself. A preview image is created, which the user is able to download.

To run the code, the HTML page must be accessed via a local server.
